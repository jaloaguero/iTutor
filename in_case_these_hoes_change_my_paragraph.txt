I designed, implemented, and maintained the database architecture that served as the foundation for all information that the website required. Leveraging the power of MySQL Workbench, I created the database schema and incorporated test entries to verify the database's functionality. To ensure maximum efficiency and maintainability, I employed inheritance to establish relationships between tables and utilized foreign keys to associate both students and tutors with a person. This allowed me to ensure that every tutor and student had the same basic requirements in regards to name and age while also allowing for distinct additional requirements, such as a tutor's description.
As part of my duties, I created, implemented, and maintained the backend using Flask, a robust web framework for Python. I utilized the built-in Flask features to establish simple temporary HTML files, which set up the basic foundation of the website, and to establish a connection between the backend and frontend. 
I also developed and implemented the login and signup system. I utilized flask_mysqldb, a MySQL database adapter for Flask, to authenticate users and connect the backend with the database. This allowed me to retrieve information from the database and display it on the website through Flask.This allowed me to create accounts for both students and Tutors using the previously mentioned HTML files and the existing database. Additionally, I implemented the necessary functionality to log in existing users by checking all entries in the database.
